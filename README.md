# Estimating Energy Expenditure Using The Pandolf-Santee Equation

Estimating the number of calories burned during a physical activity period is notoriously difficult, especially when attempting to incorporate accurate GPS data.  Most methods of estimating calories burned don't include elevation changes, and those that do, may only count uphill gains and discounted any extra effort associated with downhill progress.  The Pandolf-Santee equation makes an effort to use as much data as possible, but it's still just an estimate.

## Using 

```bash
npm install --save @mattduffy/calories
```

```javascript
import { simpleCalories } from '@mattduffy/caloies'
